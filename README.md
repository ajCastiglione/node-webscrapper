# Node WebScrapper - backend

This is the backend API for the web scrapper I am going to build. It will have a user authentication, custom requests, and personalized data storage. I am going to use firebase to store the csv files and mongodb to store user information.

## Dependencies

<ul>
<li>Node</li>
<li>Lodash</li>
<li>JWT</li>
<li>bcrypt</li>
<li>mongoose</li>
<li>mongodb</li>
<li>firebase</li>
</ul>

## Status

This project is in its infancy and I've just started to learn mongodb and Node in depth. This is more of a challenge project to test my abilities and put what I've learned to use.
